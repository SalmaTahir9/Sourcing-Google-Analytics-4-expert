1. **Delegating Research Tasks**: Initially, I requested my co-worker to delve into the task of compiling a comprehensive list of interview questions. This task entailed identifying and gathering relevant and thought-provoking questions commonly used in interviews across various job roles.

2. **Sourcing Google Analytics 4 Experts**: Another key responsibility was the search for individuals skilled in Google Analytics 4. My coworker was tasked with seeking out professionals who possess a high level of expertise in utilizing Google Analytics 4 for data analysis and interpretation.

3. **Seeking MERN Developers**: In addition to identifying Google Analytics experts, I also directed your coworker to explore the realm of MERN developers. This involved scouring the talent pool for developers well-versed in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, with the aim of potentially recruiting them to meet your project's specific needs.

4. **Initiating Contact via WhatsApp**: Taking a proactive approach, you personally reached out to potential candidates through the WhatsApp messaging platform. This step involved initiating conversations with the candidates identified in the previous research phase.
